## Project Overview:

[Unleashing DeFi Against Fake News](https://taikai.network/alephzero/hackathons/CTRL-Hack-ZK/projects/clrgwejuu026rvn01l61mow2y/idea)

Welcome to Credibility Guard, a groundbreaking project leveraging the power of DeFi and cutting-edge privacy tools from Aleph Zero to combat the spread of misinformation. Our platform empowers users to contribute to a collective effort in determining the authenticity of news while ensuring privacy and security.

Key Features:

    Privacy-Preserving Entry: Users can submit potential fake news securely and privately using Aleph Zero's advanced privacy tooling, maintaining confidentiality while contributing to the truth-seeking mission.
    Decentralized Prediction Market: Participants can stake their belief in the news' authenticity by pledging money through smart contracts on our decentralized platform. This creates a financial incentive for users to engage in accurate information verification.
    Stake-Based Verification: After a predefined period (e.g., 60 days), guardians vote on whether news if fake or not based on how many $CRDY Tokens they have staked. Game theory makes it highly likely the guardians do not cheat, as that would destroy the platform and destroy the value of the staked tokens as well, since a fee is collected and payed to them.
    Anonymous Voting: Voting on the authenticity of news is conducted anonymously, encouraging unbiased opinions and discouraging any potential manipulation. Privacy is a cornerstone of our platform.
    Early Indication: Leveraging the concept of efficient markets, our platform provides an early indication of the news' truthfulness as soon as six hours after submission. This dynamic feature enhances the speed and accuracy of our truth-detection mechanism.

Let's make a positive impact on the information landscape!

# Game Theory

At the heart of our game theory model is the incentive structure for those who upload content. Individuals motivated to share what they believe to be fake news can do so, fueled by the prospect of earning a small fee for every vote received on their proposal. This financial reward provides an inherent motivation for uploaders to contribute content that is perceived as deceptive or misleading.

On the other end, participants who cast their votes are financially motivated as well. By accurately assessing the validity of uploaded news, voters stand to increase their earnings. Their incentive lies in supporting the information that ultimately proves to be correct, as this aligns with the platform's goal of identifying fake news accurately.

The crucial component in this ecosystem is the token holders. These individuals hold the power to determine the accuracy of news after a 60-day period. Their financial stake is at risk, as their tokens' value is tied to the platform's overall health and accuracy. If token holders provide false information, it could lead to a decline in platform usage, diminishing the value of their tokens. This dual motivation – maintaining the platform's credibility and safeguarding their financial interests – ensures that token holders will truthfully verify the accuracy of the news.

In the event that a conclusive determination cannot be made, the platform adopts a fail-safe mechanism. Funds are returned to participants, emphasizing the commitment to fairness and accuracy in the face of uncertainty.
