[Unleashing DeFi Against Fake News](https://taikai.network/alephzero/hackathons/CTRL-Hack-ZK/projects/clrgwejuu026rvn01l61mow2y/idea)

Welcome to Credibility Guard, a groundbreaking project leveraging the power of DeFi and cutting-edge privacy tools from Aleph Zero to combat the spread of misinformation. Our platform empowers users to contribute to a collective effort in determining the authenticity of news while ensuring privacy and security.

Key Features:

    Privacy-Preserving Entry: Users can submit potential fake news securely and privately using Aleph Zero's advanced privacy tooling, maintaining confidentiality while contributing to the truth-seeking mission.
    Decentralized Prediction Market: Participants can stake their belief in the news' authenticity by pledging money through smart contracts on our decentralized platform. This creates a financial incentive for users to engage in accurate information verification.
    Stake-Based Verification: After a predefined period (e.g., 60 days), guardians vote on whether news if fake or not based on how many $CRDY Tokens they have staked. Game theory makes it highly likely the guardians do not cheat, as that would destroy the platform and destroy the value of the staked tokens as well, since a fee is collected and payed to them.
    Anonymous Voting: Voting on the authenticity of news is conducted anonymously, encouraging unbiased opinions and discouraging any potential manipulation. Privacy is a cornerstone of our platform.
    Early Indication: Leveraging the concept of efficient markets, our platform provides an early indication of the news' truthfulness as soon as six hours after submission. This dynamic feature enhances the speed and accuracy of our truth-detection mechanism.

 Let's make a positive impact on the information landscape!
